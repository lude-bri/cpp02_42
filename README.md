# 1. Orthodox Canonical Class form

The Orthodox Canonical Class Form (OCCF)—also known in modern terminology as the Rule of Five—refers to a set of special member functions in C++ that a class should explicitly define when it manages resources that require deep management, such as dynamic memory, file handles, or other system-level resources. The OCCF ensures correct behavior for object copying, assignment, and destruction, safeguarding against issues like memory leaks, shallow copies, and double deletions.
